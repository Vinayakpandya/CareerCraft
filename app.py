                                 A class is a building block of Object Oriented Programs. It is a user-defined data type that
                                 contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members. It is like a
                                 blueprint or template of objects having common properties and methods.

                                 A compile-time polymorphism feature called overloading allows an entity to have numerous
                                 implementations of the same name. Method overloading and operator overloading are two examples.
                                 
                                 Overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism where an entity with the same name but a different
                                 implementation is executed. It is implemented with the help of virtual functions.

                                 improve and facilitate code reuse.
